              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.

          <div class="content3">
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by

              it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
              second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
              inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth
              was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.

            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers

              Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only

              Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
              not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
              worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
              leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
              select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who
              was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

              “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as

              he tended his radio telescopes.

              Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
              the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
              in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week

                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had

                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this
                was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything,
                but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,”
                Dr. Linde wrote in an email.

              <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said

                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
                inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists
                responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I
                think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the
                greatest discoveries in the history of science.”

                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s
                mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole
                Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the
                results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.

                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
                inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the
                cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would
                eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
                inflation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized
                the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded
                earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and
                other assumptions about the universe.

              <p>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,”
                Dr. Krauss said.
              </p>

                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
                will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other
                teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                mountaintops and space.

            <h3>Spirals in the Sky</h3>
            <p>
              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
              Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
              Nobel Prize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
              waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
              series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
              Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
              Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
              Stanford.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.
